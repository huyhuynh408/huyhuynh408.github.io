      <p>
        A meticulous accountant recently turned web developer.  I enjoy organization and making sure things are done properly.  As a team member, I put the team before myself to achieve our goals.  I thrive in environments where ego is set aside and the product being finished by the deadline is top priority.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am driven by the creation of meaningful things that I can take pride in.  A recent chat with a friend reminded me of my passion to create and tinker I had forgotten about.  I was working in a role that did not stimulate me.  In that career, there was nothing that made me want to get out of bed in the morning.  Coding is where I find a lot of satisfaction in flexing new parts of my brain everyday.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to make meaningful things that are of use to the world, enrich the lives of others and that give back to the dev community.  In the meantime, I will continue working on side projects I am passionate about until I find a job where I can shine as a developer and a person.
