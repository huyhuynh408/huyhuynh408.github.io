    <h3>Ruby Classes</h3>
    <h4>March 7, 2015</h4>

    <p>
      Classes in Ruby are like the blueprints.  They tell your object what to do when you call it.  I will use an example of a die to show you what I mean.  Let's think about what a die needs to do.  To start, a regular die has six sides; numbers 1-6.  When you pick it up and roll it, a random side will land upright.  So that's it.  The basics of a die is that it starts off with one side up and when you roll it, a random side will land faceup.
    </p>

    <p>
      <div class="code">
        class Die
        <span class="indent1">def initialize</span>
        <span class="indent2">@sides = sides</span>
        <span class="indent1">end</span>
        <span class="indent1">def sides</span>
        <span class="indent2">@sides</span>
        <span class="indent1">end</span>
        <span class="indent1">def roll</span>
        <span class="indent2">rand(1..6)</span>
        <span class="indent1">end</span>
        end
        <br>
        <br>
        <span>die = Die.new</span>
        <span>die.roll</span>
        <br>
        <span>dice = [Die.new, Die.new]</span>
        <span>dice.each { |die| puts die.roll }</span>
        <span></span>
        <span></span>
      </div>
    </p>

    <p>
      Now this is an extremely basic example but it does allow us to examine the basics of Classes.  To start off, Classes in Ruby begin with a capital letter.  You may have noticed that there is a way to create an Array like this: <code>array = Array.new</code> or creating a Hash like this: <code>hash = Hash.new</code>.  Notice that the letter "A" and "H" both have to be capitalized.  That's because those are Classes.  You could do the same for Strings and Integers but it is a lot easier just to type in <code>string = "This is a new string"</code> or <code>num = 12121</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Next we see that there is an initialize method.  The method is not necessary but will be a method that runs automatically when you call on a Class.  A good way to think of it in this situation is that you cannot have a die that doesn't have any sides.  A die resting will be on one side or the other, that's why it makes sense that sides would be initialized.  Below that, you can see that there is a method for sides that just returns the instance variable sides.  This could be done with the attr_reader method but I won't go into that here.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here we finally come to some good stuff in our class.  This roll method is what we have been waiting for.  It allows us to roll the die and return a random number between 1 and 6.  You may not be familiar with <code>rand()</code> but it is quite simple.  When you put an argument into rand, it will return a random number between 0 and the number before that argument.  I used the range 1..6 instead to make it cleaner to see. This acts just like how we expect a normal die would.
    </p>

    <p>
      Okay, now that we have our Class, what can we do with it?  Well looking on the next line, you can see where I created a new object called die and set it equal to a new Die class.  This is just like creating those Arrays and Hashes above.  By setting the die to Die.new, I am creating a new instance of that object.  This is what is called instantiation.  Now with this new object, I can finally do what this Class was made to do.  By now using <code>die.roll</code> I am now using the method I just created.  This roll will now generate a random number as explained earlier.
    </p>

    <p>
      What if we wanted dice instead of a die?  Well you can see in the last part of the code that I have done just that.  I made this new object called dice out of an Array of two Die classes.  When dice is called, it will return two dice with two random numbers just like we expect.  To do this, we need to iterate through the array.  This may seem more complex, but it really just means that the code is run through each part of the Array and does what we tell it, in this case we tell it to use the roll method on each part of the Array.

    <h3>Pairing &amp; Feedback</h3>
    <h4>March 5, 2015</h4>

    <p>
      Pairing is not something that I have frequently done in the past.  Sure, I have worked on tasks with other people, but pairing in a driver/navigator roles were completely new to me.  It is something that I think is very useful to learn and very important when learning how to code.
    </p>

    <p>
      I don't have a problem pairing and I kind of like doing it this way.  The only problem I face when pairing is finding a pair that can fit into my schedule.  Working full-time makes it a little hard to find people who are on the same schedule.  Once Phase One begins, this will not be an issue as I will be pairing everyday.  Another thing that is frustrating is communicating bad things.  I always try to be nice and not offend anyone so sometimes I don't want to broach a subject because of that every reason.  In DBC there is really not a time or place to keep doing this.  I must not be worried about this and make sure I get my ideas across in a respectful manner.
    </p>

    <p>
      I enjoy pairing because I get to teach others and also learn from others.  No matter how technically inclined the other person is, there is also something that I can learn from them.  There were lots of times that I learned something that would help either in my code or workflow.  When I have a better understanding on a particular subject than my pair, it allows me to teach.  I try to be patient and let my pair work out as much as I can and only guide them so that I don't take away from their learning by telling them the answers.
    </p>

    <p>
      I generally feel pretty happy about the feedback I have received.  Most of the feedback has not been very specific so it is harder to make improvements.  I think it's very common to not want to give bad feedback but it makes it harder to improve if you don't get those kinds of response back for your work.  I think this is a great idea to have more feedback but unless they are more critical and specific, it will be harder to improve.  Just hearing that it was nice and fun to pair with me is good but not entirely helpful for me.  From my feedback, I will definitely want to brush up on my skills with rspec.
    </p>
      I find that writing feedback is hard and probably why the feedback I received were not too critical.  The biggest problem I have is trying to find specific items I think could be addressed by my pair.  Usually the pairing goes really well and things went smoothly.  I am not sure what kind of critiques I can give in those situations.

    <h3>Enumerable&#35;cycle</h3>
    <h4>March 1, 2015</h4>

    <p>
      I chose the Enumerable&#35;cycle because I was not familiar with this method and it would be nice to research what it.  Here is what <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.0/Enumerable.html#method-i-cycle">Ruby Docs</a> has to say about this method.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>cycle(n=nil) { |obj| block } → nil
      <br>cycle(n=nil) → an_enumerator</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      Calls block for each element of enum repeatedly n times or forever if none or nil is given. If a non-positive number is given or the collection is empty, does nothing. Returns nil if the loop has finished without getting interrupted.
    </p>

    <p>
      #cycle saves elements in an internal array so changes to enum after the first pass have no effect.

      If no block is given, an enumerator is returned instead.
    </p>

    <p>
      So what does this even mean in regular English?  Simply put, it allows you to call a block on your object a specific number of times, or if you don't give it a number, it will continue looping the block forever.  Let's look at some examples:
    </p>

    <p class="code">
      a = ["a", "b", "c"]
      <br>a.cycle { |x| puts x }  # print, a, b, c, a, b, c,.. forever.
      <br>a.cycle(2) { |x| puts x }  # print, a, b, c, a, b, c.
    </p>

    <p>
      Looking at the second line, we can see that if we use the cycle method with the block of <code>{ |x| puts x }</code>, the array will keep printing on forever.  On the third line, we see that by using the argument of 2, the array only prints twice and stops.
    </p>

    <h3>The Patent Problem</h3>
    <h4>March 1, 2015</h4>

    <p>
      So it is already March and it's still cold outside.  No matter, there are more important things to consider.  This morning I saw <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/02/27/how-apple-lost-533-million-to-an-8th-grade-dropout-patent-troll/?xid=yahoo_fortune">this article</a> about Apple losing $533 million dollars to a patent troll.  This problem seems to be a unnoticed by a lot of people and affects more than just the tech world.
    </p>

    <p>
      The patent issue in tech seems to go unheard of quite often.  Even recent the lawsuit between Apple and Samsung does not shed enough light on the core problems with the patent system.  In this day and age, it is too easy to patent.  Not only is it easy to patent, it is also troubling that corporations are buying patent portfolios to sue other companies.  All of the time and money spent in the courts over these ridiculous cases could be better spent anywhere else.
    </p>

    <p>
      My first problem with the current patent system is how easy it is to get a patent.  The system was created in a different time for different purposes.  There is no way the the old system could think of all of the intricacies of the modern world and it shouldn't have to.  There should be a new system in place that can properly handle real world issues.  Take for example, the <a href="http://www.google.com/patents/USD670286">patent USD670286 S1</a> where Apple was able to patent a portable display device in a shape of a rectangle with rounded corners or British Telecom <a href="http://www.google.com/patents/US4873662">patent US4873662 A</a> that patents the patents hyperlinks.  It seems ridiculous to be able to patent such basic and simple concepts, kind of ridiculous as a patent on toasting bread.  There's no way that the patent office would let someone patent an idea as fundamental as this.  Well <a href="http://www.google.com/patents/US6080436">patent US6080436 A</a> would make you think differently.  Apparently you can patent toast!  I should file for a patent on wearing underwear under pants before some crazy nutjob gets there first.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another problem is that there is no real way to protect yourself from patent trolls if you are a small business. If you were sued by a troll, the time and effort it would take to fight could be the ruin of your company.  Even if small businesses won in court, the drawn out battle and hefty lawyer fees the damage would already be done.  Even settling the lawsuit would not be a clear victory.  The amount of money to settle would cut into profits if you even had enough money to pay it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The system is clearly broken but how do we fix it?  I don't know, I am not familiar enough with it to give any answers, nor is anyone asking me for them.  I would suggest that patent reform be taken seriously.  We cannot innovate if we are being stifled by trolls and corporations wielding frivolous patents.  Until then, we can only hope we don't get caught in this mess.

    <h3>My Thinking Style and Learning</h3>
    <h4>February 22, 2015</h4>

    <p>
      From the Gregorc Thinking Style quiz, my learning style was Concrete Random.  According to Gregorc, these is the the way I learn:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>This learner likes:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>experimenting to find answers</li>
        <li>take risks</li>
        <li>use their intuition</li>
        <li>solving problems independently</li>
      </ul>
        <strong>They learn best when:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>they are able to use trial-and-error approaches</li>
        <li>able to compete with others</li>
        <li>given the opportunity to work through the problems by themselves.</li>
      </ul>
        <strong>What's hard for them?</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Restrictions and limitations</li>
        <li>Formal reports</li>
        <li>Routines</li>
        <li>Re-doing anything once it’s done</li>
        <li>Keeping detailed records</li>
        <li>Showing how they got an answer</li>
        <li>Choosing only one answer</li>
        <li>Having no options</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      With the knowledge of how I learn best, I can optimize the way I learn at DBC while also minimizing the bad ways I learn.  For example, by knowing that I do no like keeping detailed records, I can work harder to make sure I get that done.  That can be accomplished in different ways, but I believe by make small reachable habits, I will be able to overcome those shortcomings in the future.
    </p>

    <p>
      So far my experience in Phase 0 has had its ups and downs.  There were times when I was extremely excited to build something and went at it 100%.  Then there were also times I was having trouble getting motivated to do the work.  I believe a lot of it is in part to doing rather than reading and also the workload.  In week 2, I felt the best because I was making my own website and was able to see the results of my hard work.  I was very excited to tinker with my website and come up what I had imagined.  There was also a lot of other material that I needed to cover to get there so I enthusiastically studied.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the third week, the workload was dramatically less than week 2 and we were not building programs that I was much too interested in.  I had already been through some of the reading that was required so it was mostly just brushing up since I haven't written and Ruby code in a couple weeks.  I think these two factors combined made this week a little tougher to get through than the previous week.  I ran into some very difficult problems in the exercises but once I got through those, I didn't feel the same sense of satisfaction as when I was building my website.  A few times I did get lost in concentrating and really enjoyed the work.  I think that once I start building a project, I will really be eager again to learn as much as I can to get my project working the way they do.  Until then, it will probably be a little bit of a struggle to be eager about all the things I have to learn.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since we are thinking about learning, it would be smart to think of the fixed v. growth mindset.  I do truly believe that the growth mindset is what really sets up the leaders and the followers.  I hope to think of myself in the former camp.  It is all too common to see someone play things safe just because they are scared of the consequences.  A lifetime of playing it safe will result in a mediocre life, at least mediocre in your true potential.  Although I hope I am not a hypocrite when I say that but I do really believe it.  There are certainly times when I don't want to push myself but I have to overcome those fears.  One of the reasons I am going to DBC is to get away from my safe, boring job and try to do something I will actually like.  If I fail, no big deal, I will have gone away from this experience with a lot of knowledge of myself.  Even a failure at DBC is not really such a big deal to me.  We all have to fail at some point and since I haven't really pushed myself to do something this out of my comfort zone, this will be a good time as any to see how I fare.  What is really the worse thing that could happen anyways?  I would most likely be out of a job for a few months, but I will get back on my feet again.  It's not like I have a wife or kids to care for.
    </p>

    <p>
      To really get the most out of my learning, I should really embrace everything.  I should learn to embrace other people and their knowledge.  I should embrace taking chances, I should be more agreeable and willing to accept more criticism.  Anything that can help me become a better developer/person is something that I need to embrace.  Embrace will now be the word I need to ingrain in my mind.  It is something that I need to think about when I am struggling or not feeling motivated.

    <h3>Hashes v. Arrays</h3>
    <h4>February 22, 2015</h4>

    <p>
      Today I learned more about hashes and arrays.  The two are very similar but also quite different.  Each has its use and different syntaxes.  The easiest way to tell the difference between an array and a hash is the key/value pairs.  In arrays, the key is an integer.  In hashes the key is any object like a string or integer.  The value in arrays and hashes could be almost anything you want, they could easily be strings, integers, floats, other arrays, etc.  Let's take a quick look at the syntax for both.
    </p>

    <p>
      Arrays are written with brackets like this: <code>[]</code>. Hashes are written with braces like this: <code>{}</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      An example of an array would be <code>[1, 'Bob', 'Chicago']</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The same hash would be <code>{:one => 1, :name => 'Bob', :city => 'Chicago'}</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now I didn't mention it earlier but you can see two big differences from the hash example.  The first is the <code>:</code>.  The colon denotes that whatever comes after it is the key to whatever comes after the <code>=></code>.  What does that even mean?  It is pretty simple, the first part is the key and the second is the value.  You can think of it sort of like a dictionary.  If you look up the word apple in the dictionary, the word apple would be the key and the definition of apple would be the value.  The same applies to arrays but their values are already predefined as integers.  The key to the number 1 in the first array example is 0, the key to number 2 is 1, etc.  The keys/indexes for arrays begin at 0 and then 1 for the next value, then 2, etc.  I have no idea why indexes start at 0 but that's the way most computer languages have it written.
    </p>

    <p>
      To make it more clear, let's see how we can call back the values from arrays and hashes.  To call the name Bob from an array, we would need to find it's place in the index.  Since it is in the second place it has an index key of 1.  Then to call Bob in an array we would type <code>[1]</code>.  To do the same in a hash, we would need to find the key.  I have conveniently named the key for Bob as name.  To call Bob from a hash we would type <code>['name']</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      As you can see from the example, there are some benefits and drawbacks of each method.  Arrays would be better for an ordered lists that you don't need to remember specific keys to.  Hashes on the other hand would be better for lists that you would want to know what keys are needed to access them.  The difference would be like if you wanted a shopping list and wanted to know which was the first item on the list and a dicitionary where you want to know what word to look up to find its definition.

    <h3>Inline v. Inline-Block</h3>
    <h4>February 15, 2015</h4>

    <p>
      Cascading style sheet has a a lot of ways to help you display elements properly on your website.  One of the most useful feature is inline and inline-block.  This allows you to have elements on the same line instead of on different rows.  Let's see how it looks and then we will go into the difference between inline v. inline-block.
    </p>

    <p>
      <h5>Block</h5>
      <img src="../imgs/block.png" alt="block" />

      <h5>Inline</h5>
      <img src="../imgs/inline.png" alt="inline" />

      <h5>Inline-Block</h5>
      <img src="../imgs/inline-block.png" alt="inline-block" />
    </p>

    <p>
      As you can see in the above pictures, the three different display attributes leads to the divs elements showing up differently on your screen.  In the first image, you can see that the block display lines puts each new element on its own line.  It also keeps the width and height attributes intact.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the second image, you can see that the inline display puts all of the elements on the same line.  Each element is now the same exact size both in height and width.
    </p>
        In the final picture, the four elements are now in the same line but still maintain their original height and width.
    <p>

    <p>
        The biggest difference between inline-block and inline is the block attribute in inline-block.  Inline-block still keeps the elements on the same line as inline but it also acts just like the block display.  It allows the elements to retain their height and width attributes.  In the inline picture, all of the divs have the same shape because they are limited by the text they contain.  They are only as big as whatever is in them.  In inline-block, you can specify those attributes even if most of it is empty.
    </p>

    <h3>In the Kitchen</h3>
    <h4>February 05, 2015</h4>

    <p>
      The DBC experience seems like a tough one with lots of challenges ahead, kind of like starting a video game and not know what is exactly ahead.  There will be a lot of work ahead but there will also be guidance.  Although there will be people along the way, it will be up to me to get what I need out of the program myself.  In coding, there is no shortcut.  You either know what you are doing or you do not.
    </p>

    <p>
      You will survive or fail based on your own capabilities.  It may seem tough but I don't see a way around it.  When I go into an interview, I better be prepared and know what I am talking about.  This is exactly one of the reasons I signed up for DBC.  I really needed a kick in the pants to get me to where I want to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since going through some of the exercises on CodeAcedemy, I realized that I have a tremendously hard time learning in a structured environment.  I have forgotten how to study.  I am glad to begin DBC and learn things the hard way again.  The money I have already put in will hopefully motivate me further from squandering my time here.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am also glad that DBC focuses on more than just the mechanics but also the process of learning.  Ever since watching some of the Thinking About Time materials in the first challenge, I have noticed that I have more willpower than I thought.  I have already become a little less lazy just by doing a few little things.  I really hope this sticks and builds good habits.  I know I am going to need it in 8 weeks.

    <h3>Version Control</h3>
    <h4>February 04, 2015</h4>

    <p>
      There are two great benefits to version control: collaboration with others and multiple saved files.  Version control (we are learning Git but it applies to all version control software) allows a very large number of individuals to work on the same file at the same time.  It does this by having a master file from which you can create branches that you can play around with it.  When you are satisfied with the results, the changes are merged with the master.  It will find the parts that were changed and only modify those.  That means that you can be working on one part of the file while your partner works on another.  Then you can come back to combine the work you have done.
    </p>

    <p>
      In case there were any issues, you can revert back to an older master file.  That is the other benefit of version control.  It allows you to see all of the files that you have commited (saved).  It works very very similarly to a save point in a game.  You can proceed forward but if you ever wanted to return to a checkpoint you always can.  If for example,  you were working on a branch (a copy of the master file) and were having bugs that you couldn't figure out, it may be beneficial to start from scratch.  In that instance you still have the master file without having to manually unravel your mess.  It also works great in situations where you want to see why certain code was typed the way they were or if you wanted to see who made those changes.  These records are always available and makes your life easier in case you had questions.
    </p>

    <p>
      In DBC we are using GitHub to store our code.  GitHub is similar to Git in that it shares the same great benefits but it is online.  Being online allows anyone access from any computer.  I can download the files I need and when I am done, I simply upload them to GitHub for storage.  Then any of your teamates can do the same.  It allows you to easily share the work that you do with the rest of the world.
