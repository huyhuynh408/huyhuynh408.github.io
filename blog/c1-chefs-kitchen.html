      The DBC experience seems like a tough one with lots of challenges ahead, kind of like starting a video game and not know what is exactly ahead.  There will be a lot of work ahead but there will also be guidance.  Although there will be people along the way, it will be up to me to get what I need out of the program myself.  In coding, there is no shortcut.  You either know what you are doing or you do not.

      You will survive or fail based on your own capabilities.  It may seem tough but I don't see a way around it.  When I go into an interview, I better be prepared and know what I am talking about.  This is exactly one of the reasons I signed up for DBC.  I really needed a kick in the pants to get me to where I want to go.

      Since going through some of the exercises on CodeAcedemy, I realized that I have a tremendously hard time learning in a structured environment.  I have forgotten how to study.  I am glad to begin DBC and learn things the hard way again.  The money I have already put in will hopefully motivate me further from squandering my time here.

      I am also glad that DBC focuses on more than just the mechanics but also the process of learning.  Ever since watching some of the Thinking About Time materials in the first challenge, I have noticed that I have more willpower than I thought.  I have already become a little less lazy just by doing a few little things.  I really hope this sticks and builds good habits.  I know I am going to need it in 8 weeks.
