      Cascading style sheet(CSS) has a a lot of ways to help you display elements properly on your website.  One of the most useful feature is inline and inline-block.  This allows you to have elements on the same line instead of on different rows.  Let's see how it looks and then we will go into the difference between inline v. inline-block.

    <p>
      <h5>Block</h5>
      <img src="../imgs/block.png" alt="block" />

      <h5>Inline</h5>
      <img src="../imgs/inline.png" alt="inline" />

      <h5>Inline-Block</h5>
      <img src="../imgs/inline-block.png" alt="inline-block" />
    </p>

      As you can see in the above pictures, the three different display attributes leads to the divs elements showing up differently on your screen.  In the first image, you can see that the block display lines puts each new element on its own line.  It also keeps the width and height attributes intact.

      <p>
        In the second image, you can see that the inline display puts all of the elements on the same line.  Each element is now the same exact size both in height and width.
      </p>
        In the final picture, the four elements are now in the same line but still maintain their original height and width.

        The biggest difference between inline-block and inline is the block attribute in inline-block.  Inline-block still keeps the elements on the same line as inline but it also acts just like the block display.  It allows the elements to retain their height and width attributes.  In the inline picture, all of the divs have the same shape because they are limited by the text they contain.  They are only as big as whatever is in them.  In inline-block, you can specify those attributes even if most of it is empty.
