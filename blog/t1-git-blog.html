      <h5>Version Control</h5>
      There are two great benefits to version control: collaboration with others and multiple saved files.  Version control (we are learning Git but it applies to all version control software) allows a very large number of individuals to work on the same file at the same time.  It does this by having a master file from which you can create branches that you can play around with it.  When you are satisfied with the results, the changes are merged with the master.  It will find the parts that were changed and only modify those.  That means that you can be working on one part of the file while your partner works on another.  Then you can come back to combine the work you have done.

      In case there were any issues, you can revert back to an older master file.  That is the other benefit of version control.  It allows you to see all of the files that you have commited (saved).  It works very very similarly to a save point in a game.  You can proceed forward but if you ever wanted to return to a checkpoint you always can.  If for example,  you were working on a branch (a copy of the master file) and were having bugs that you couldn't figure out, it may be beneficial to start from scratch.  In that instance you still have the master file without having to manually unravel your mess.  It also works great in situations where you want to see why certain code was typed the way they were or if you wanted to see who made those changes.  These records are always available and makes your life easier in case you had questions.

      In DBC we are using GitHub to store our code.  GitHub is similar to Git in that it shares the same great benefits but it is online.  Being online allows anyone access from any computer.  I can download the files I need and when I am done, I simply upload them to GitHub for storage.  Then any of your teamates can do the same.  It allows you to easily share the work that you do with the rest of the world.
